[Milking App](https://milking-tracker-three.vercel.app/)

## Introduction

The Milking App is a mobile-first web application designed to help dairy farmers track their milking sessions while incorporating music to enhance cattle yield. This app uses Vite and React for a fast and modern development experience.

## Why Vite?

We chose Vite for this project because of its simplicity and speed, which are ideal for small projects. Vite provides a rapid development environment with minimal configuration, making it a perfect fit for this application.

## Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/milking-app.git
   cd milking-app
   npm install or yarn install
   npm run dev or yarn dev
   ```

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
